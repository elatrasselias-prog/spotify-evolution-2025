## 1. Project Goal
This project investigates the Spotify Global Music Dataset (2009-2025) to uncover trends in song characteristics. The goal is to apply software development best practices as required by the HAX712X course, including data analysis, object-oriented design, and reproducible reporting with Quarto.

## 2. Data Loading & Inspection
First, we load the dataset using the `pandas` library. This step is crucial for verifying the data's structure and ensuring our analysis is based on a clean foundation. The table below shows the first 5 rows of our data.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import os

# Load the dataset from the 'data' directory
# This relative path ensures the code is reproducible
df = pd.read_csv("data/spotify_data.csv")

# Display the first 5 rows in a table
df.head(5)
