## 1. Introduction
This analysis investigates the Spotify Global Music dataset to uncover trends in song duration and popularity, as required for the HAX712X Software Development course.

## 2. Data Loading & Inspection
First, we load the dataset to inspect its structure. This ensures our data is clean before analysis.

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load data from the 'data' folder
df = pd.read_csv("data/spotify_data.csv")

# Display the first 5 rows in a table
df.head(5)
